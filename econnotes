Notes for economy patch. 

 * Make ContractInfo more general, allowing for any deliveries, not just food to Castles. 
   - Refactor Farmland::demandSupplies to use this. 

Supply routes:
 * Castles have transport capacity. 
 * Speed and capacity.
 * Make trips to visit forces, possibly getting ambushed.
 * Multiple trips if necessary.
 * Foraging.
