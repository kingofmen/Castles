Problem: When medieval armies meet, one of them will almost certainly
disband. When black-powder armies meet, they will quite likely part with
their fighting power intact. The current Action model does not reflect
this lowering of the stakes.

Solution: Implement a centralising modifier to the die roll, which moves
you down if the roll is above average, and up otherwise. Make this modifier
tech-dependent.
