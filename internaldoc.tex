\subsection{Cows}

Supplies available to a Hex are depicted as cows. The maximum number
of cows is given by the \texttt{maxCows} parameter in the
\texttt{cowPositions} object of \texttt{gfx/info.txt}. Their positions
are shown in the same object, relative to one corner of the pasture
field of the hex. The number of supplies represented by one cow is
$M_st/M_c$, where $M_S$ is the highest number of supplies in the game
at start, $t$ is the \texttt{cowTolerance} parameter of the
\texttt{cowPositions} object, and $M_c$ is the \texttt{maxCows}
parameter.
