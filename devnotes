Thoughts:
 Who owns the land? King, local noble, farmers? 
 Farmers will work their own land, but must be paid or forced to work others'. 
 Same for other production - need a framework. 
 Econ sequence:
  Village produces labour
  Deliver forced labour to overlords (feudal dues) 
  Deliver contract labour in exchange for goods
  Farmlands (and others) decide how much labour they need
  Owners set supply/demand curves for labour
  Hold market
  Run production
  Deliver goods to owners
  Money/goods taxation
  Consume/invest  
  Renegotiate contracts and dues

 It is necessary to create this "already in motion". 
 Is it steady-state? Balancing needed.
 Player should be able to interact with this! Set bids, offers, investment. Taxation!
