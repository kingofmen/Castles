Suggestions from forums:

 * Perspective (check)
 * Make terrain flat colours
 * Two rows for villages is boring
 * Fog - darker pixels in the distance
 * Sprites light on top, dark below
 * Darker background, ie terrain
 * Check CK colour scheme
 * Political map mode 
 * Finer-grained texture

Next gameplay iteration (thoughts, not all to be implemented):

 * Militia raids
   - Punitive expedition
   - Tribute
   - Self-castling
 * Supply line interference
 * Raid/tribute/battle mapmode 
 * Three-resource economy
   - Mine, forest, farm
   - Text setup
   - Contracts
   - Markets
   - Trade
 * Sieges
 * Command points
