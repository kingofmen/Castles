Suggestions from forums:

 * Perspective (check)
 * Make terrain flat colours
 * Two rows for villages is boring
 * Fog - darker pixels in the distance
 * Sprites light on top, dark below
 * Darker background, ie terrain
 * Check CK colour scheme
 * Political map mode 
 * Finer-grained texture

Next gameplay iteration (thoughts, not all to be implemented):

 * Militia raids
   - Punitive expedition
   - Tribute
   - Self-castling
 * Supply line interference
 * Raid/tribute/battle mapmode 
 * Three-resource economy
   - Forest
   - Mine
   - Close the loop: Make Village consume the food it gets (and have effects on birth/death rate)
   - Restore clearing of land
   - Normalisation
   - Ending of contracts
   - MilUnits as EconActors
   - Dilution of capital
   - Decay of goods
   - Trade
   - Forced labour
   - Taxation
   - Player interaction
 * Sieges
 * Command points
