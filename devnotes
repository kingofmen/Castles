Suggestions from forums:

 * Perspective (check)
 * Make terrain flat colours
 * Two rows for villages is boring
 * Fog - darker pixels in the distance
 * Sprites light on top, dark below
 * Darker background, ie terrain
 * Check CK colour scheme
 * Political map mode 
 * Finer-grained texture

It would be good to refactor this to make use of the cool features from BattleFront, 
and maybe make all the code a bit more generic - there'a a lot of specialised classes.
Then again, perhaps a graphics engine is indicated. 

Next gameplay iteration (thoughts, not all to be implemented):

 * Militia raids
   - Punitive expedition
   - Tribute
   - Self-castling

   - Mine, forest, farm
     1. Split Pop and Farm info (check)
     2a. Allow capital to substitute for labour (check)

     1. Create class (check)
     2. Read prices from save (check) 
     3. Need some sort of notation for indifference or utility. (check)
     4. Now need to calculate utilities! (check)
     5. Find supply-demand intersection. (check)

Thoughts:
 Who owns the land? King, local noble, farmers? 
 Farmers will work their own land, but must be paid or forced to work others'. 
 Same for other production - need a framework. 
 Econ sequence:
  Village produces labour
  Deliver forced labour to overlords (feudal dues) 
  Deliver contract labour in exchange for goods
  Farmlands (and others) decide how much labour they need
  Owners set supply/demand curves for labour
  Hold market
  Run production
  Deliver goods to owners
  Money/goods taxation
  Consume/invest  
  Renegotiate contracts and dues

 It is necessary to create this "already in motion". 
 Is it steady-state? Balancing needed.
 Player should be able to interact with this! Set bids, offers, investment. Taxation!
